# Goalkeeper 

Just like any other player, your goalkeeper can be moved in a [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/movement_phase). Your goalkeeper can also be moved 1 hex whenever the ball comes into the box.

# Positioning to make a save

You can dive 3 hexes in either direction parallel to the goal line when attempting a save. If a shot is 4 or more hexes away, you can’t save it!

# After making a save and holding the ball

The goalkeeper has three choices:

1. Kick the ball. Before this kick is taken, any players who are in either final third get to move up to 6 hexes each. The goalkeeper’s team moves first.
2. Take a quick throw. No players get to move first. The throw can travel the distance of a standard pass and cannot be intercepted by an opponent. The throw subject to standard pass rules except interceptions. 
3. Make a [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/movement_phase) or Pass/Long Pass/High Pass (With GK rules for a high pass), **but**, the GK drops the ball to feet and cannot pick up any more. This is now open play.

If you choose to kick the ball, judge the accuracy of the kick using the goalkeeper’s High Pass attribute (a combined score of 8+ is required. This kick is a High pass with the exception that the ball can travel as far as the opposite final third. If the pass is inaccurate, follow the [Loose Ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/loose_ball) instructions to find the final destination. (it must initially be targeted on a teammate's head)

Both teams get to move one player up to 3 hexes while the ball is travelling in the air. If a defender is within distance to challenge for a [Header](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/heading) (i.e. within 2 hexes), then play resumes with a header. If no defender is close enough to challenge for a header, the attacking player can continue play with a header or Control Attempt. If no one is in range for a header, play continues with a Movemet Phase.

## Competing for a high cross

If your opponent crosses the ball into the box, you can challenge to catch the ball. If the ball is aimed within one hex of you, then have a duel with your opponent (see [Heading](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/heading)).

After the Accuracy Check the GK has the option to move 3 Hexes, but the GK can only do this if they intend to challenge for the high ball (not just for better positioning), and that they have **not already** moved 3 hexes per the high cross rules.

If the cross ball is aimed 2 hexes away from you, your combined score suffers a -1 dice penalty. If the attacker wins the duel, a goal is scored! If you win the duel, play resumes as if you caught a shot (see After making a save).

## Intercepting a pass

If the path of a pass travels directly through you, then you will automatically intercept the pass. If the path of the ball takes it within one hex of you, roll a 5 or 6  or 10+ combined with Saving to Save and Hold.

## Diving at the feet of the attacker

Goalkeepers do not have a Tackling attribute, but they can instead dive with their hands at a player's feet. To try this, you and your opponent roll the dice. Add your Saving attribute to the dice roll and compare that to the attacker’s Dribbling attribute plus dice roll.

You can dive at the attacker’s feet during a:

- Defensive [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/movement_phase) if you move to an adjacent hex. Regular GK Tackling duel.
- Attacking [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/movement_phase), if an attacker attempts to dribble the ball around, you can try to dive at their feet (but you can choose not to). You can dive 3 hexes in either direction, parallel to the goal line. Diving at feet on the 3rd Hex away has a -1 dice penalty. The GK has the ability to “dive at feet” anytime a player is within a saving hex, even if a snapshot is about to be called on said saving hex

- GK can save/dive through opponents and teammates. If the GK is successful, and has to move on an occupied Hex, the GK moves all players from the occupied Hex and the direction of the dive one Hex away

However, if you roll a 1 in either situation, a foul has been committed and a penalty kick is awarded!

If GK makes a successful dive, play continues with "Save and Hold"

You can also attempt to stop an opponent who is outside of the box. Before attempting a tackle outside the box with your GK, please declare if you are tackling with your feet, or diving with your hands:

- If attempting a tackle with your feet, your goalkeeper's tackling attribute is zero. Conduct a regular tackling vs dribbling duel.
- If attempting to win the ball with your hands outside the box, conduct a saving vs dribbling duel. If the goalkeeper is successful, play is stopped for a free kick and the goalkeeper is shown a straight red card

Tackles and dives take place on the attacker's Hex, so pay attention on your position when trying tackles or dives.

## Goalkeeper's Saving Penalty

In the Core Rules, your goalkeeper can dive 3 hexes parallel to the goal line. The same is true with the Advanced Rules, but there’s a twist: if the goalkeeper attempts a save in the furthest away hex (the third hex), the goalkeeper’s Saving attribute suffers a -1 dice penalty.

Please remember that the keeper can only save parallel to the goal line, there is no Zone of Influence for saving.
However the GK can try to deflect a shot that passes through his ZOI (most probably behind him) by rolling a 6 or a 10+ with a combined score of Saving and Dice Roll.

Goalkeepers can dive for a save or Tackle through opponents and teammates. In case a Save or a Deflection takes place on an occupied Hex, the occupant is legally pushed one Hex away in the direction that the GK dived, pushing all other players in line one Hex.

## Goalkeeper's Snapshot Penalty

When an attacker calls a snapshot and you choose your goalkeeper as the one to move two hexes, your saving ability suffers a -1 dice penalty on the second hex away and a -2 dice penalty on the third hex away.

## Goalkeepers can pick up the ball

Goalkeepers can run to get the ball. If the ball is in their penalty box and it did not come from a teammate's kick, they can pick it up using their gloves. Continue Play as if there was a save and Hold. You can only pick the ball up when a [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/movement_phase) ends (with a change of possession or regularly).

## Goalkeepers cannot be marked at set-pieces

Attack cannot place a player on a Hex that is in the 6-yard-box AND touching the GK position.
