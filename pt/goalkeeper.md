# Goalkeeper 

Just like any other player, your goalkeeper can be moved in a [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/pt/movement_phase). Your goalkeeper can also be moved 1 hex whenever the ball comes into the box.

# Positioning to make a save

You can dive 3 hexes in either direction parallel to the goal line when attempting a save. If a [shot](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/pt/shooting) is 4 or more hexes away, you can’t save it!

# After making a save and holding the ball

After a GK saves and holds a ball, wins an aerial duel or picks the ball up when in the box after collecting a loose ball or stray pass from the attacking team, they have two initial options:


1. **Activate final thirds**: both teams can move any player in either final third a maximum of 6 hexes each. The goalkeeping team goes first.
2. **Quick Throw**: Neither team is able to move their final thirds, the throw can be the length of a standard pass but cannot be intercepted. The receiving player continues as if they have just received a regular standard pass.

**Remember**: _If the GK collects a loose ball outside the penalty area, they follow any other scenario. If they wish to pick the ball up, the GK only picks the ball up once the phase in which he is brought back into the box completely finishes. If the GK collects a loose ball within the penalty area, they pick it up immediately._

If the player chooses to activate final thirds, they continue by doing the following two options:

- **GK Kick**: The ball can land on any hex except those in the opposite final third, however the ball must land on an attackers head. There is no penalty if an inaccurate high pass results in the loose ball ending up in the opposite final third. After determining where the goalkeeper plans to kick the ball both teams can move 1 player up to 3 hexes. The GK then needs a combined score of 8+ to be accurate. After determine the final position of the ball, if a defender is close enough to header and the defending team wishes to do so, the receiving player must head the ball. If no defender is in range to challenge, or the defending team choose for nobody to challenge, the attacking team can choose to either have a free header or bring the ball down. If the kick is inaccurate and the loose ball results in the ball being in a position where nobody is able to attempt a header or control, continue with a movement phase.
- **Drop the Ball**: The GK drops the ball and is now treated as an outfield player. From here the attacking team can declare a movement phase, standard pass, high pass or long ball however normal outfield player distances, accuracy checks and rules apply. The GK cannot pick the ball up again after dropping it.

**If the attacker rolls a 1 when shooting**: The activate final thirds action must follow. The GK must be positioned inside the 6 yard box when taking the kick. From here, a standard pass or a GK kick can follow. The standard pass can be intercepted, the GK Kick follows the rules stated above.


## Competing for a high cross

If your opponent crosses the ball into the box, you can challenge to catch the ball. Your goalkeeper can do that by challenging for the Header (after the High Pass) using their Aerial Ability attribute. If the ball is aimed within 2 hexes of you, then you can choose to have a duel with your opponent (see [Heading](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/pt/heading)).

After the Accuracy Check the GK has the option to move 3 Hexes, but the GK can only do this if they intend to challenge for the high ball (not just for better positioning), and that they have **not already** moved 3 hexes per the high cross rules.

If the cross ball is aimed **2** hexes away from you, your combined score suffers a -1 dice penalty. If the attacker wins the duel, a goal is scored! If you win the duel, play resumes as if you caught a shot (see After making a save and holding the ball).

Following an aerial challenge, like any outfield player the GK is also unable to move as part of the subsequent movement phase. However, they are still able to move 1 hex if the ball leaves then re-enters the box, as well as be used as the player moving 2 hexes if a snapshot is declared.

## Intercepting a pass

If the path of a (standard, first-time) pass travels directly through you, then you will automatically intercept the pass. If the path of the ball takes it within one hex of you, roll a 5 or 6  or 10+ combined with Saving to Save and Hold.

## Diving at the feet of the attacker

Goalkeepers do not have a Tackling attribute, but they can instead dive with their hands at a player's feet. To try this, you and your opponent roll the dice. Add your Saving attribute to the dice roll and compare that to the attacker’s Dribbling attribute plus dice roll.

You can dive at the attacker’s feet during a:

- Defensive [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/pt/movement_phase) if you move to an adjacent hex. Regular GK Tackling duel.
- Attacking [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/pt/movement_phase), if an attacker attempts to dribble the ball around, you can try to dive at their feet (but you can choose not to). You can dive 3 hexes in either direction, parallel to the goal line. Diving at feet on the 3rd Hex away has a -1 dice penalty. The GK has the ability to “dive at feet” anytime a player is within a saving hex, even if a snapshot is about to be called on said saving hex

- GK can save/dive through opponents and teammates. If the GK is successful, and has to move on an occupied Hex, the GK moves all players from the occupied Hex and the direction of the dive one Hex away.

However, if you roll a 1 in either situation, a foul has been committed and a penalty kick is awarded!

If GK makes a successful dive, play continues with "Save and Hold"

You can also attempt to stop an opponent who is outside of the box. Before attempting a tackle outside the box with your GK, please declare if you are tackling with your feet, or diving with your hands:

- If attempting a tackle with your feet, your goalkeeper's tackling attribute is **zero**. Conduct a regular tackling vs dribbling duel.
- If attempting to win the ball with your hands outside the box, conduct a saving vs dribbling duel. If the goalkeeper is successful, play is stopped for a free kick and the goalkeeper is shown a **straight red card**.

Tackles and dives take place on the attacker's Hex, so pay attention on your position when trying tackles or dives.

## Goalkeeper's Saving Penalty

In the Core Rules, your goalkeeper can dive 3 hexes parallel to the goal line. The same is true with the Advanced Rules, but there’s a twist: if the goalkeeper attempts a save in the furthest away hex (the third hex), the goalkeeper’s Saving attribute suffers a -1 dice penalty.

Please remember that the keeper can only save parallel to the goal line, there is no Zone of Influence for saving.
However the GK can try to **deflect** a shot that passes through his ZOI (most probably behind him) by rolling a 6 or a 10+ with a combined score of Saving and Dice Roll.

Goalkeepers can dive for a save or Tackle through opponents and teammates. In case a Save or a Deflection takes place on an occupied Hex, the occupant is legally pushed one Hex away in the direction that the GK dived, pushing all other players in line one Hex.

## Goalkeeper's Snapshot Penalty

When an attacker calls a [snapshot](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/pt/shooting) and you choose your goalkeeper as the one to move two hexes, your saving ability suffers a -1 dice penalty on the second hex away and a -2 dice penalty on the third hex away.

## Goalkeepers can pick up the ball

Goalkeepers can run to get the ball. If the ball is in their penalty box and it did not come from a teammate's kick, they can pick it up using their gloves. Continue Play as if there was a save and Hold. You can only pick the ball up when a [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/pt/movement_phase) ends (with a change of possession or regularly).

## Goalkeepers cannot be marked at set-pieces

Attack cannot place a player on a Hex that is in the 6-yard-box AND touching the GK position.
