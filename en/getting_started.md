# Getting Started

A team squad is made up of 16 players; 1 [goalkeeper](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/en/goalkeeper), 10 outfielders and 5 substitutes. Here’s how to draft squads at the start of the game.

For online Games on Tabletopia, and especially official ones (matches played for some competition organized by members of the Counter Attack Community), players usually draft 2 [goalkeepers](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/en/goalkeeper), and 14 outfield players.

## [Goalkeepers](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/en/goalkeeper)

Place the goalkeeper cards face down and pick 1 goalkeeper each.

Official Online games: Flip the GK deck so that all cards are face down, shuffle the deck at will, Take 4 cards, Roll the dice to see who picks first and pick two each. Many people chose to lay all the cards down to the pitch, (by selecting take 14 -all of them) then the two managers have all the cards in their view so select from there.

## Outfield Players

Shuffle the cards and place 4 of them face up. You choose 1 of these cards, your opponent chooses next. You then pick 1 of the remaining cards and your opponent takes the final card. Repeat this process with the rest of the player cards, taking turns with who picks first. Keep going until you both have 15 outfield players.

Now it’s time to decide which 11 players will make up your starting team, and which will be your 5 substitutes. Allocate a squad number 1-11 to each starting player and place them in their corresponding spaces at the sides of the pitch.

Official Online games: Roll dice for who picks first, flip the outfield players deck, so that all cards are facing down, shuffle the deck at will, "Take" 4 cards, place those cards face-up for both players to see and pick one card each until all 4 cards are taken. Repeat process until each player has 14 outfield players,  taking turns on who picks first. The winner of the initial rolls should get 4 first picks and the other manager gets 3 first picks. (7 turns in total, each player gets 2 players in each turn, totals 14 outfield players)

## Referee

Place the referee cards face down and pick 1 at random. Place the referee card face up at the side of the pitch.

## Added time

At the end of each half, roll the dice and add the result to the referee's Leniency. Play continues for that many Actions before the half/match is over. **The maximum number of actions there can be in each half is 7 (3 in extra time of cup games). The only time an action can be exceeded by 1 is if a penalty is awarded in the last action of the half.**

An Action is what an attacker can call as the next thing to happen.  The actions are the following: Movement Phase, Standard Pass, First Time Pass, Short Pass (from a throw-in or a corner), Goalkeepers’ Quick Throw, High Pass, Long Pass, Header, Attempt to control the ball, and (Snap)Shot).

**These are NOT actions:**
- The **first** movement phase before a throw (if a second movement phase is called, the latter counts as an action since it is optional).
- A nutmeg because it is part of the movement phase.
- The final thirds movement.

## Jackpot ⭐ Roll

When the game is played using 12-sided dice, the Jackpot Roll is in effect.  If a player rolls a ⭐ they automatically win whatever duel they are contesting. This is called a jackpot roll. If the opponent also rolls a ⭐ then the contest is a tie, regardless of the attribute values for those players, and is resolved as usual with a loose ball. For all other rolls, treat the ⭐ as a 6.
Duels are the following:
- Shots vs Saves
- Tackling vs Dribbling
- GK Dive at Feet vs Dribbling
- Header Challenge
