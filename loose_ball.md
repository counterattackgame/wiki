LOOSE BALL

The Loose Ball instructions determines where the ball ends up whenever:

a defender successfully deflects a shot
a high pass or long pass is inaccurate
a tackle, a header or a shot ends in a tie
the GK after saving a shot fails to hold on to the ball.

Refer to the numbers 1-6 printed on the pitch. This helps you determine where the ball will break. The ball deflects from the centre of the incident (i.e. where the ball was supposed to travel, or from the defender who challenged for a tackle or header)




Roll a dice to determine the direction the ball will break. If you roll a 3, the ball will break in the direction of the 3, and so on.

To determine the distance the ball will break, roll a dice again. The dice roll will tell you how many hexes the ball will travel. Start counting from the source of the loose ball.

If the ball does not hit any player while travelling, continue the Movement Phase or, if you were not in a Movement Phase, begin one with the attacking team moving first.
If the ball hits a defender while it is travelling, that player’s team is now in possession. Resume play with "Any other Scenario"
If the loose ball is picked up by a defender, the Movement Phase ends immediately and play continues with "Any other Scenario"
If the loose ball hits an attacker during a movement phase, continue the movement phase, or if you were not in a Movement Phase, begin one with the attacking team moving first, but the attacker can choose to Snapshot immediately.
If the loose ball comes from an inaccurate high pass, the ball travels directly from the passer to the new destination. Play resumes from this point, following the rules of headers or with a Movement Phase if a header is impossible.
If the loose ball comes from an inaccurate long pass, the ball travels directly from the passer to the new destination. Play resumes from this point with a Movement Phase.
Goals can be scored from loose balls! If the ball passes within 1 hex of the goalkeeper, the goalkeeper needs to roll a 5 or a 6  or 10+ combined with Saving to save it! If the ball passes more than 1 hex from the goalkeeper, it cannot be saved.
How to deflect shots:If the shot travels though a defender, roll a 5 or 6  or 10+ combined with Tacklling to deflect.
If it passes within 1 hex, roll a 6 or 10+ combined with Tackling to deflect.
