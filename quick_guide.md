# QUICK GUIDE

## Shooting

Shooting outside area = -1 dice penalty
Difficult angle shots = -1 dice penalty
Dice roll of 1 = shot off target

## Deflecting shots

If in path of ball, 5 or 6 OR Tackling 10+ deflects the ball
Within 1 hex of ball, 6 OR Tackling 10+ deflects the shot
Use [Loose Ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/loose_ball) rule for deflections

## Snapshot

Can take snapshot at any time in penalty area
Can also snapshot outside the box (refer to ‘what next’ card)
-1 dice penalty for snapshots
Defending team gets to move 1 player up to 2 hexes on a snapshot

## Goalkeeper

Gets a 1 hex move whenever ball enters penalty box
Can dive 3 hexes parallel to goal line
Furthest hex away = -1 dice penalty
If GK moves at snapshot, -2 dice penalty on 3rd hex, -1 on 2nd hex
Handling: if dice roll is => Handling, corner kick is awarded
Can also dive at attacker’s feet (3 hexes max): Saving vs Dribbling

## GK Distribution

**THROW**: No player moves first. Throw distance of standard pass. No interceptions. The throw can travel the distance of a standard pass and is subject to standard pass rules except interceptions. 
**MOVEMENT PHASE**: Keeper Drops ball to feet and play on.
**DROP THE BALL/KICK**: Outfield players rule apply with ability to play High Pass (Can kick to anywhere except opposite Final Third with accuracy =>8
) / Long pass / Standard pass

## Loose Ball

Refer to grid on the pitch and decide which player will roll for this
First roll is direction, second roll is distance
If ball hits a player while travelling, that team takes possession
Otherwise, attacking team continues with Movement Phase
If a [loose ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/loose_ball) follows a High Pass, contest the header in the new landing location.
If no-one can challenge for a header, the ball is on the ground.

## Corner kick

Decide who will take the corner kick; place player at corner arc
Both teams pick up and reposition 6 players, moving two at a time
Attacking team moves first
Both teams move one player up to 3 Hexes (Attack goes first)
Play continues with
(a) High Pass: Can be placed anywhere in penalty box Both teams move 1 player up to 3 hexes first ACCURACY: =>8
(b) Short pass: Can travel the distance of a first-time pass. You **cannot** play a first time pass after a low pass in this scenario

## Throw-in

Decide who will take it and place player there
Conduct a Movement Phase (optional: conduct a second Movement Phase)
Throw ball (with a standard pass) the distance of a first-time pass WITH interceptions.
Throw ball to the head of your teammate up to the distance of a first-time pass WITHOUT interceptions. A Header must follow.

## Free Kick

Defenders must be be 2 hexes away from the ball
Pick up and reposition players following this pattern:
2 Attacker / 2 Defender / 2 Attacker / 2 Defender / 3 Attacker / 2 Defender
Now choose to pass or shoot
If shot is =>9, no defender can block it
Remember -1 for shooting outside of the box
Any player standing within 1 hex from the ball can take the kick

## Penalty Kick

Pick up and resposition all players
No players allowed in the penalty area and arc, except taker and keeper.
GK has -2 dice penalty

## Standard Pass

Can’t travel through an opponent
Opponent can intercept within 1 hex of the path with a 6 or 10+ tackling

## First Time Pass

1 player from each team moves 1 hex as ball travels
Opponents within 1 hex of the path can intercept with a 6 or 10+ tackling
Opponents who move into path of ball can intercept with 5 or 6 or 10+ tackling

## Long Pass

Can travel to any hex on the pitch
Can’t aim within 5 hexes of a teammate or 1 of an opponent
Opponent GK moves according to pace
ACCURACY: High pass + dice =>9
ACCURACY: (Final Third to Final Third) =>10

## High Pass

Can’t make the pass if opponent is within 1 hex and in path of the pass
1 player from each team moves up to 3 hexes as ball travels
Must always aim at teammate
ACCURACY: High Pass + dice =>8

### Header

A maximum of 2 outfield players from each team within 2 hexes from the ball can challenge
Announce which player is rolling
2 hexes away = -1 dice penalty

### Control a High Pass

Only possible if no opponent can challenge for a header
ACCURACY: Dribbling + dice =>9

## Steal

If attacker moves within 1 hex of defender, roll a 6 or 10+ tackling to win the ball

## Tackle

If defender moves within 1 hex in a Movement Phase
Tackling + dice vs Dribbling + dice
Dice roll 1 is always a foul
Winner repositions around opponent
### Tackle from Behind

A roll of 1 or 2 is a foul
2 hexes behind attacker considered ‘behind’
Attacker is always facing the goal
If you fail the Leniency test, receive a red card.
Otherwise receive yellow

### Reckless tackle

Announce reckless tackle before attempting it
Can foul players who do not have the ball
1 or 2 = foul failed. Yellow card issued
3+ = foul committed and play stops
If you fail the Leniency test, receive a red card.
Otherwise receive yellow

## Fouls

Roll for booking.
If red card, play must stop for a free kick/penalty
Roll for injury
Attacker then decides to play on or take the foul

## Nutmeg

Can only be attempted if you have the pace to get through
Defender gets +1 for Tackling
Dice roll of 1 from the Defender is a Foul
If successful, defender is stunned and cannot move.
If tied: [loose ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/loose_ball), attacker who initiated nutmeg cannot move - regardless of how much pace he has already used
