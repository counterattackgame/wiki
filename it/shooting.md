# Shooting

Shooting is a duel between the player taking the shot and the goalkeeper.

Shots from outside the penalty area receive a -1 dice penalty.

Snapshots receive a -1 dice penalty.

If the shot is taken from outside the penalty box, the goalkeeper gets to move 1 hex before attempting a save.

1. If the attackerâ€™s score is higher, a goal has been scored!
2. If the keeperâ€™s score is higher, roll a dice:

- If you roll equal to or higher than the goalkeeperâ€™s Handling, run a [Loose Ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/loose_ball) test. If the direction is behind or to the side of the GK a Corner Kick has been conceded. If the direction is in front of the GK, roll for direction too and play contines with the [Loose Ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/loose_ball) process.
- If you roll lower than the Handling attribute, you catch the ball. If the ball is caught, possession changes hands to the goalkeeperâ€™s team.

3. In the event of a tie, follow the [Loose Ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/loose_ball) instructions.


## Snapshot

A snapshot sacrifices accuracy for the element of surprise. Take one:

- During the attacking team's player movements in a [Movement Phase](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/movement_phase) if a player has or takes the ball in the opposition's penalty area OR immediately when a [Loose Ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/loose_ball) hits an attacking player in the opposition's penalty area or outside the box within shooting distance.
- Immediately following a pass, whether inside or outside the penalty area.

All the same rules of shooting apply, but the playerâ€™s Shooting attribute receives a -1 dice penalty.

Just before the snapshot is taken, 1 opponent is allowed to move any player 2 hexes in an attempt to deflect the shot (see [Loose Ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/loose_ball)). This can include the [goalkeeper](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/goalkeeper).

In the Advanced Rules, if you choose the goalkeeper to move 2 Hexes (for the snapshot), the keeper gets a -1 saving penalty on the 2nd Hex away and a -2 penalty on the 3rd Hex away.

The sequence that must be followed is:

1. Attack calls Snapshot
2. Defence moves 1 player (up to) 2 Hexes.
3. Attack calls the direction of the shot. Agree on which defenders can attempt to block. Resolve any block attempts. If the ball is blocked , play the [Loose Ball](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/loose_ball). If not proceed below.
4. Agree on the Hex that the keeper will attempt to save, and calculate any potential penalties for the saving.
5. Roll dice for shooting and saving. If attack rolls a 1 the shot is off-target.

In case of a SHOT, the direction is called at the same time as the action itself, and shot process starts from the third bullet above.

Please note:

- Attacker has moved and is with the ball at feet right outside the area. He escapes a tackle during Def MP and repositions in the area. He **CANNOT** snapshot.
- Attacker moves in box, attacker snapshots and the ball gets deflected by def/GK right back on THE shooter. He **CAN** snapshot.
- Attacker moves in box, attacker snapshots and the ball gets deflected by def/GK right ON another attacker who HAS moved. He **CAN** snapshot.

Following an aerial challenge, a [keeper](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/goalkeeper) is still eligible to move 1 when the ball enters the box and also take advantage of the 2 moves following a snapshot declaration.

## Difficult Shooting Angles

Certain positions on the pitch within shooting range are difficult to score from due to the angle. Shooting from hexes marked with a small circle is possible but your shooting suffers a -1 dice penalty.

## Deciding the hex of potential save for the GK

Always remember that:

- Shot attempts (Snapshots, Shots and [Headed](https://counterattackgame.github.io/wiki/it/heading) attempts at Goal) travel in a STRAIGHT line.
- Goalkeepers can only save in hexes parallel to the goal line. There is a theoretical 7-Hex-wide saving wall consisting of the GK position and 3 hexes in each side, always parallel to the goal line.
- Ball travels on a line, but is not a dot, it is circluar with a NON negative radius, so while travelling it may use many more Hexes than a player would use to travel the same route.
- The Goalkeeper always saves in the **closest** hex that the ball trajectory dictates.
